# telegram-channel-subscriber-counter
A tool used to record the numbers of subscribers to a telegram channel

The Python file [telegramChannelSubscriberCounter.py](https://github.com/KElee01/telegram-channel-subscriber-counter/blob/main/telegramChannelSubscriberCounter.py) is what I used now, you can do some change to make it useful to you.
# Usage

You can change `Safari` in line 5 into browser you use like `Chrome`.
## URL Configuration
You can change `https://t.me/NewlearnerChannel` in line 7 into any Telegram Channel Share Links you like.
## Log file
You can change `telegramSubscriberCountLog` in line 25 into any other file name as you like.
The default log file path is the same as the Python file `telegramChannelSubscriberCounter.py`.
